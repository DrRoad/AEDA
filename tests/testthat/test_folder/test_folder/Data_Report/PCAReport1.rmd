## Principal Components Analysis Report for numeric data

Principial Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction method that uses an an orthogonal transformation
to reduce a large set of (numeric) variables to a small set of (numeric) variables, called principal components, that still contain
most of the information of the large set. Those computed principal components are linearely independent, and hence uncorrelated.
The first principal component accounts for as much of the variability/variance in the data as possible, and each succeeding component
accounts for as much of the remaining variability/variance as possible.

```{r loadPCAObj_z0rmTofUiofkUG8p, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}


if (!require("DT",character.only = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("DT",dep=TRUE)
    if(!require("DT",character.only = TRUE)) stop("Package not found")
    }
z0rmTofUiofkUG8p = readRDS("z0rmTofUiofkUG8p.rds")
```

### Prinicipal Component Analysis Summary Results

In the following the principal component rotation (loadings) and the corresponding scree as well as
      scatterplot will be displayed. 

#### Rotation Loadings and Standard Deviation

The following datatable shows the matrix of variable loadings:
```{r showRotationAndSD_z0rmTofUiofkUG8p, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
dt = DT::datatable(z0rmTofUiofkUG8p$pca.result$pca.result$rotation, class = 'compact', filter = 'bottom', options = list(pageLength = 5),
      caption = htmltools::tags$caption(
      style = 'caption-side: bottom; text-align: center;',
      'Table : ', 'Principal Component Rotation Loadings'
      ))
dt
```

The variances of the 1. to 4. principial component are: `r head(z0rmTofUiofkUG8p$pca.result$pca.result$sdev) ` .

#### Screeplot for principal component analysis

The following plot shows the percentage amount of variance each principal component explaines
      in descending order:

```{r showScreePlot_z0rmTofUiofkUG8p, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width = '90%'}
z0rmTofUiofkUG8p$pca.result$plotlist$pca.scree
```

#### Scatterplot for individual observations

The following plot shows how the observations are transformed onto a 2-dimensional space
      using the rotation/loadings for the first two principal components applied to each origin numeric variable:

```{r showScatterPlot_z0rmTofUiofkUG8p, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width = '90%'}
z0rmTofUiofkUG8p$pca.result$plotlist$pca.scatter.1
```
