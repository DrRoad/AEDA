Description: Writing exploratory data analysis (EDA) scripts helps in extracting valuable information
 from the data but can be very time consuming. Often people are producing the same tables and figures
 again and again which could be automatized with EDA scripts. 
 This package automates the process of creating an EDA report by providing analysis & plot functions
 which, one would normally script for each data type of dataset.
